# Will My Bag Fit

### A web application to help you check if your bag will fit the carry on limits of various airlines.


## How it Works
- Select the unit of measurement (cm or in)
- Enter your bag's dimensions in the input fields
- Check the list of compatible airlines
- Use the search bar to filter the results by airline name

## Limitations
As of August 2024 there isn't a library of airline's baggage allowence, therefore the list has been populated manually, hence being so limited.

## Contributing
If you'd like to add more airlines to the database or contribute to the project in any way, feel free submit a pull request.
