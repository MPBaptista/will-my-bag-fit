# Will My Bag Fit

### A web application to help you check if your bag meets the carry-on size limits of various airlines.

## How It Works
- Select your preferred unit of measurement (cm or in).
- Enter your bag's dimensions in the input fields.
- View the list of airlines that accommodate your bag size.
- Use the search box to filter the results by airline name.

## Limitations
As of August 2024, there is no comprehensive library of airline baggage allowances. Therefore, the list has been manually populated and is currently limited in scope.

## Contributing
If you'd like to add more airlines to the database or contribute to the project in any other way, feel free to submit a pull request.
